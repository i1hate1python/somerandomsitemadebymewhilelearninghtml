    <h1 id='main'>Makima (マキマ?)</h1>
    <p id='main2'>"Your necessary evil is just an excuse to justify your own crimes. Those excuses are unnecessary to society. The truly necessary evils are always kept collared and controlled by the state."

        "I want to use Chainsaw Man... to create a better world."
        
        "Any source of happiness you experience? I'll be the one to create and destroy it all. You helped me kill Power. There might have been a way for you to save Hayakawa, but you killed him too. You even murdered your own father. Someone like you has no right to wish for a normal life, do they?" ― Makima trying to break Denji</p>
